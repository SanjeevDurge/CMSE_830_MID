    "Welcome to CMSE 830 final project presentations! \n",
    "\n",
    "The general plan is that you are in a group of five who will review five web apps, all assigned randomly. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your group will turn in one Jupyter notebook that will contain reviews of all five web apps. Those reviews will be mostly in the form of tables. To make things move quickly, I recommend using AI to create markdown tables from information you obtain during the web app review.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If there is a major failure of a web app (e.g., the link doesn't work), contact either Max or me immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Read through this carefully for about ten minutes and put together a plan that is time aware. See the helper code at the bottom. Consider assigning one person in your group to be a time keeper and another to be a \"table filler\". \n",
    "\n",
    "4. You know the basic things we are looking for from the recent homework and test run on Tuesday. But, I also include here an email from CEO Dr. Chen who has the specific guidance she would like to see. And, since she is the boss, I'll turn it over to her.....\n"
