# NYC Taxi Ride Duration Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a regression model that accurately predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. The dataset used for this project is provided by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). It contains various features such as:

- **Pickup time**
- **Pickup and dropoff geo-coordinates**
- **Number of passengers**
- **Distance traveled**
- **Trip distance**
- **And other relevant variables**

The goal is to create a model that can estimate the ride duration based on these features, which could be beneficial for taxi companies, ride-sharing apps, or city planners to improve trip estimation, fleet management, and customer experience.

## Key Features of the Project
- **Data Processing**: Cleaned and processed the raw data to handle missing values, outliers, and irrelevant data points.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized and analyzed the data to understand relationships between variables and identify key features that influence trip duration.
- **Modeling**: Developed various regression models, including linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, to predict the total ride duration.
- **Evaluation**: Assessed the performance of the models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to ensure the best model is selected.
- **Deployment**: Built a Streamlit app to interactively explore taxi ride data and visualize predicted ride durations.

# **Machine Learning Model Development and Evaluation**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to explore, preprocess, and model a dataset to predict a target variable effectively. Various machine learning models were built and evaluated, with a focus on improving predictive performance. The repository includes feature selection, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and comparison of multiple regression algorithms.

---


### **Key Preprocessing Steps:**
- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputed missing values using median/mode.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Applied one-hot encoding.
- **Feature Scaling**: Used Min-Max scaling to normalize the data.
- **Feature Selection**: Selected features using a custom feature selection method and analyzed their importance.

---

## **Modeling Approach**

### **Models Implemented:**
1. **Decision Tree Regressor**
   - A baseline model to explore overfitting issues and the impact of tree depth on performance.
   - Hyperparameter tuning: `max_depth` was varied between 7 and 20.
   
2. **Random Forest Regressor**
   - Ensemble model to reduce overfitting.
   - Hyperparameters used:
     - `n_estimators=200`
     - `max_depth=12`
     - `min_samples_split=20`

3. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
   - Gradient boosting over decision trees for robust predictive performance.
   - Hyperparameters used:
     - `learning_rate=0.5`
     - `n_estimators=100`
     - `max_depth=6`
     - `min_samples_split=30`

## **Evaluation Metrics**
### **RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error):**
Used to evaluate model performance, considering penalization of large prediction errors.

- **Train RMSLE**: Measures the model's error on the training set.
- **Validation RMSLE**: Measures the model's error on unseen validation data.

---

## **Feature Importance**
For tree-based models, feature importance was extracted to understand the contribution of each feature to the predictions.

```python
feature_importance = grad_boost.feature_importances_
print(feature_importance)
```

---

## **Results and Comparison**

| **Model**              | **Train RMSLE** | **Validation RMSLE** |
|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Decision Tree Regressor | 0.35            | 0.50                  |
| Random Forest Regressor | 0.30            | 0.40                  |
| Gradient Boosting       | 0.25            | 0.35                  |

### **Observations:**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**: High overfitting due to lack of generalization.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Improved performance with reduced overfitting.
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**: Achieved the best results with minimal error.
